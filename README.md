# SyncLoop
## Dubbing and subtitling application

 This is an application I created for personal use. I was working as a translator for cable channels TV shows and needed a way to sync the dialog loops to the translated content. It was my first (and so far only!) incursion in the realm of C#; a programming language I got to really like.  
 It's not by any means a polished application. Since it was for personal use only, I kept postergating some bug fixes and polishing that needs to be done.
 Anyway, the goal now is to port this to Electron (Node) to be able to run it anywhere.
